// Version built into this binary.  Keep in step with the GitHub release tag

// One-shot background check of the project's GitHub releases.  Runs entirely
// on its own low-priority thread: start it once after http_init() succeeds
// and it never blocks or slows the caller.  Every failure (no network, DNS,
// TLS handshake, timeout, bad JSON) is treated as "no update available".
// Each run traces its steps and the raw API response to
// /dev_hdd0/tmp/update_detection.txt regardless of the Debug Logging setting.

// even if update_check_start() was never called.

// True once the worker has finished (whether or not it found an update).  At
// that point it has already unloaded the HTTP/HTTPS/SSL modules and freed its
// pools, so callers that ran the check early (before reserving big buffers) can
// poll this to know its memory is released again.
bool update_check_done(void);

// True once the check has finished AND found a release newer than
// APP_VERSION; copies the release tag (e.g. "V2.1") into out.  Poll it from
// a render loop — it never blocks.

// still running.  Its memory (~0.5 MB for HTTPS/SSL) comes from the heap as
// it is then; if that is short the check fails and says so, nothing worse.
