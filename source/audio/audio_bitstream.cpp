// Ask the console to put a COMPRESSED bitstream on the HDMI wire instead of
// LPCM, and put it back afterwards.
//
// Why this can exist at all: PSL1GHT never bound cellAudioOut, so nothing in
// this app could express the request.  That is a missing binding, not a
// missing capability -- see audio_out_stub.S.  cellAudio (the port) still
// carries our ordinary float LPCM; cellAudioOut decides what the PORT is
// then turned into on the way out.
//
// What each mode is, in the XMB's own vocabulary:
//
//   AC-3 / DTS      The hope was "Bitstream (Mix)": the system encodes our
//                   LPCM to Dolby Digital or DTS and sends that, so a receiver
//                   that mishandles multichannel LPCM -- e.g. one that
//                   silently drops the centre channel, taking the dialogue
//                   with it -- gets a stream it decodes itself.
//
//                   TESTED 2026-09-18, RESULT GENUINELY AMBIGUOUS -- do not
//                   record it as either a success or a failure yet:
//
//                     * audioOutConfigure(AC-3) returns 0 and the
//                       configuration reads back encoder=1, every playback.
//                       That proves nothing on its own; the read-back echoes
//                       what was ASKED FOR, exactly as getsockopt(SO_RCVBUF)
//                       reports a receive buffer nothing is backing.
//                     * The soundbar lights no Dolby Digital indicator.
//                     * But the CENTRE CHANNEL STARTED WORKING.  With the
//                       Dialogue setting on NORMAL -- no fold, no boost, the
//                       shipped path -- dialogue came out of the centre
//                       speaker for the first time.  Before this it was only
//                       audible via CENTER_STEREO's LoRo downmix.
//
//                   The only audio-path change against v1.0 is this call, and
//                   the output was ALREADY ch=6 downmix=0 at startup, so the
//                   one thing that changed is encoder 0 -> 1.  A chain that
//                   mishandles 8ch LPCM but decodes AC-3 correctly would
//                   behave exactly like this, and plenty of bars show no
//                   indicator over ARC.  Equally, the encode may not be
//                   happening and something else about re-configuring the
//                   output fixed the routing.
//
//                   audioOutGetState reports the mode the output is actually
//                   in, so that is what begin() believes below, and the log
//                   says CONFIG-ONLY when it disagrees with the read-back.
//                   Settle it from that line, not from the indicator.
//
//                   If it turns out the system does NOT encode for us: the
//                   Blu-ray player imports cellDdlEnc2/cellDtsEnc2 directly,
//                   so the encode would be ours to do via libddlenc2.sprx.
//
//   RAW (0xff)      CELL_AUDIO_OUT_CODING_TYPE_BITSTREAM.  A long shot, and
//                   included because it costs one enum value to try: it is the
//                   coding type that would correspond to "Bitstream (Direct)",
//                   true passthrough.  Reading the Blu-ray player's own import
//                   table shows no audio-output PRX at all, so its passthrough
//                   almost certainly runs through lv2 or the VSH audio path
//                   rather than anything callable here.  Expect silence; the
//                   read-back below will say so rather than leaving it on.
//
// Safety: unlike the display, a wrong audio mode cannot lock anyone out -- the
// worst case is silence with the UI still fully visible and usable.  Even so
// this verifies by reading the state back and reverts itself if the console
// did not end up where it was asked, so a mode the chain refuses does not
// persist.
