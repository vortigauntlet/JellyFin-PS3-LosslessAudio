//  A folder of music files as an album
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  What the browser needs to turn the audio files of a folder into a play queue: each file's tags kept
//  in a track record, the order an album is played in, the names to show, the album's title and artist,
//  and the cover art by way of a small registry the thumbnail cache asks (the cover is bytes inside a
//  file, or a picture file in the folder).
//
//  Pure (no PS3 headers): tests/test_local_music.cpp compiles this file.  Reading the files is
//  local_music_fs.cpp's job.
