//  Local MPEG-TS files -- index and seek for offline playback
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Online, a seek asks the server for a new transcode at StartTimeTicks and
//  the stream starts clean at a keyframe with PTS ~0.  A downloaded media.ts
//  is one continuous stream, so a seek has to find its own way in:
//
//    * where:  a byte offset whose video PTS is at (or just before) the
//              target -- interpolation search over the file, a handful of
//              small reads, no index file;
//    * how:    at a keyframe (random_access_indicator) and at the PAT that
//              ffmpeg's mpegts muxer writes right before every keyframe.
//              The player resets its demuxer on every seek, so without that
//              PAT/PMT the keyframe itself would be dropped and the picture
//              would come back only at the next one.
//
//  The clock is kept honest the same way as online: the entry's PTS minus the
//  file's first PTS is the absolute position the player's play_base_us
//  anchors to (its avsync re-latches on the first frame after a seek).
//
//  Pure, over a read-at callback, so tests/test_offline.cpp drives it on
//  real TS bytes.  PTS parsing is dl_ts's (offline/dl_ts.h), not a copy.
