// --- CPU-vs-GPU background compositing -----------------------------------
// On real PS3, the framebuffer lives in RSX-local VRAM and PPU writes to it
// are uncached and very slow (a full-screen CPU fill costs ~150-180ms), so the
// XMB background is rendered with the RSX (wave_draw's immediate-mode path) and
// only small UI elements (text, key cells) are composited by the CPU.
//
// RPCS3 emulates that VRAM as ordinary host RAM, and — crucially — presents the
// GPU-rendered surface from its render-target cache on flip, silently dropping
// any later CPU writes to the same buffer.  The result is a frame where the GPU
// wave shows but every CPU-drawn element is invisible.
//
// The fix is: on the emulator, composite the *entire* frame — background
// included — on the CPU so no GPU op owns the display surface and the flip
// presents exactly what we drew.  On hardware, keep the GPU wave.
//
// This is a COMPILE-TIME switch, not runtime detection.  A startup probe that
// timed one full-screen CPU write misclassified real hardware (PPU write-
// gathering beat the threshold), which put a retail PS3 on the CPU path —
// every frame then read back uncached VRAM and the whole UI crawled.
// The flag lives in build_config.h (BUILD_FOR_RPCS3) — the single switch
// for emulator vs hardware builds.

// Ribbons read as translucent veils over the background gradient: bright at

// gradient (and any earlier ribbons) at that exact height, using the same
// maths as tools/ui_preview/preview.c.  Drawn fully opaque, the GPU's plain
// colour interpolation reproduces the veil pixel-for-pixel with blending off.

// was why.  That claim is FALSE and cost this project a measured 2,129 us per
// frame -- the largest single item left in the Home frame.
// source/player/gpu/player_rsx.cpp draws every video frame from interleaved
// vertex arrays with three bound textures, and source/player/hud/hud_dim.cpp
// draws a COLOR0-carrying quad the same way, both on this console.  What broke
// the early attempt was a STALE BINDING, not the fetch unit.  Two disciplines
// fix it, and the vertex-array path below follows both:
//
//   * rsxInvalidateVertexCache() immediately before every rsxDrawVertexArray.
//   * Reset the attrib bindings after the last draw (COLOR0 re-bound at
//     stride 0, TEX0 left disabled), so nothing downstream inherits an array
//     binding it did not ask for.  hud_dim.cpp does exactly this.
//
// At 1920x1080 the wave is ~4,708 vertices; immediate mode costs two FIFO
// writes each.  The array path writes them once into RSX-local memory (PPU
// writes to VRAM measured 767 MB/s, faster than to main memory) and then
// issues 25 draw calls -- one per triangle strip -- against a single binding.
//
// Gated on /dev_hdd0/tmp/jellyfin_gpuwave.txt = 1 while it is unproven, for

// which takes the console off the network and needs a power cycle.  Delete the

// section 3b is explicit that the shape should come from a spline over a
// small control grid rather than from summed sines, and wave_field.h is that
// pipeline: a driven, damped spring chain per ribbon, resampled through a
// uniform cubic B-spline.  See tests/test_wave_field.c.
//
// Nothing below this line changed.  The field supplies a unitless
// displacement and wave_crest turns it into a screen row exactly as it always
// did, so wave_bg, wave_node, the NDC conversion, the strip layout, both
// submission paths and the gate file are all untouched.

//   measured over 20,000 frames the peak wanders in [0.198, 0.653].  The sine
//   reached 1.0 before being multiplied by WAVE_AMP, so without this the
//   ribbons would be a third shallower than they are today.
//
//   WF_DRIVE[li].  MEASURED: chain amplitude is linear in drive, and

// --- vertex-array submission ---------------------------------------------
// Vertex layout is hud_dim.cpp's: 4 floats of position then 4 unsigned bytes of
// colour, which the attrib bindings below read exactly as that already-proven
// path does, so the wave's vertex program (4-component POS + COLOR0, same as
// the HUD dim program) needs no change at all.
//
// The one difference from hud_dim is that this struct is padded to 24 bytes
// rather than the natural 20 -- see the block comment on WaveVert.  The RSX
// side is unaffected: the stride passed to rsxBindVertexArrayAttrib follows
// sizeof, and the colour still sits at +16.
// This struct is 8-BYTE ALIGNED and its colour is ONE u32, not four u8 fields.
// Both are load-bearing, and the alignment is what actually keeps the console
// alive.
//
// MEASURED REASON FOR aligned(8).  This buffer is RSX local memory, and the PPU
// cannot issue a MISALIGNED 64-bit store to it -- doing so faults and takes the
// GPU down with it: black screen, console off the network, power cycle.
//
// Unpadded the struct is 20 bytes, so every odd vertex starts on a 4-byte but
// not 8-byte boundary.  GCC is free to merge two adjacent 4-byte fields into
// one `std`, and at those offsets that store is misaligned.  Whether it does so
// depends entirely on scheduling:
//
//   colours as compile-time constants -> it wrote the whole 80-byte block as
//     ten `std` at offsets 0,8,16,...,72.  All aligned. Worked, by luck.
//   colours as runtime reads of g_theme (Phase 1 of the XMB revamp) -> it wrote
//     per-vertex instead, emitting `std` at offsets 20, 28, 60 and 68.
//     Misaligned. Hung on the first frame, every time.
//
// Same values, same field widths -- only the scheduling moved.  aligned(8)
// makes sizeof 24 so every vertex starts 8-byte aligned and any merge GCC picks
// is safe. The stride passed to rsxBindVertexArrayAttrib follows sizeof, so the
// four padding bytes cost nothing but a slightly larger buffer.
//
// Do NOT drop the padding to "save memory", and do not assume a 4-byte-aligned
// struct in VRAM is safe because the current build happens not to merge stores.
//
// Colour is packed rather than four u8 fields for the neighbouring reason: the
// PPU cannot do sub-word stores to this memory either.
//
// MEASURED REASON.  This buffer lives in RSX local memory (rsxMemalign below),
// and the PPU cannot reliably issue sub-word stores to it -- a single-byte
// write wedges the GPU bus, taking the console off the network until it is
// power-cycled.
//
// As four u8 fields it USED to be safe only by accident: every colour written
// here was a compile-time constant, so GCC folded r/g/b/a into one 32-bit
// store.  The moment the palette became a runtime read of g_theme (Phase 1 of
// the XMB revamp) it could no longer fold them and emitted `stb` per channel --
// 57 byte-stores in wave_draw where the constant build had 25 -- and the first
// vertex of the first frame hung the console every time.
//
// Packing it explicitly makes the single aligned store a property of the code
// instead of a property of the optimiser. Big-endian PPC writes this u32 as
// bytes r,g,b,a at +0..+3, so the memory layout and the GCM_VERTEX_DATA_TYPE_U8
// binding at vo+16 are byte-for-byte what they always were.
//
// Anything else that writes vertex or texture data into VRAM must obey the same
// rule: whole aligned words, never bytes.

//
// The first hardware run said the geometry costs 7,411 us of PPU per call to
// build -- 848 ns for each of its 8,740 vertices -- against an estimate of
// 400-700 us.  The frame went 16.68 ms to 21.3 ms and lost its 60 Hz lock.
//
// THE GPU WAS NOT THE PROBLEM, and the log says so unambiguously: `sync`, the
// bucket where the PPU stalls on the RSX fence, FELL from 4,135 us to 3,375.
// Had rasterisation become expensive it would have risen. It fell because the
// PPU now takes so much longer that the GPU gains slack. 8,740 vertices, 7
// draws and the extra blended fill cost the RSX nothing measurable.
//
// So the cost to attack is the per-vertex arithmetic, and the cheapest way to
// attack it is not to do it as often.

// --- speed ----------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A JellyWave-only multiplier on wf_step's dt, as a percentage.
//
// It exists because the old ribbons moved +/-30 px and this band moves about
// +/-320, so the SAME angular drift rate reads as far more agitated -- the
// wave looked too fast on a TV at a rate that was correct for the geometry it
// replaced.  WAVE_FIELD_DT itself is not touched: it is calibrated against the
// drift the original sine had, the legacy modes still run on it, and changing
// it would silently re-time mode 2 as well.
//
// Slowing down also calms the texture for free, which is the other half of
// what the wave needed.  wave_kernel.h injects its perturbation scaled by
// sqrt(h), so a smaller dt puts in proportionally less broadband noise per
// frame as well as advancing the travelling waves less.
//
// 50 (half speed) is the default rather than 100 because 100 is the rate that
// was judged too fast on hardware. Override in /dev_hdd0/tmp/ without a
// rebuild -- the whole point of the file is that "elegant" is a judgement made
// on a TV, not at a compiler.

// Rebuild the geometry every Nth call and let the RSX re-draw the buffer it
// already has in between.  At N = 3 the 7,411 us build amortises to about
// 2,470 us a frame, which is what buys the 60 Hz lock back.
//
// THIS IS SAFE WITH THE DOUBLE BUFFER, and in fact safer than what it
// replaces.  The two buffers exist because the RSX fetches asynchronously, so
// rewriting memory a queued draw has not consumed yet would tear the geometry.
// Today every call flips and rewrites, so a buffer is reused after ONE
// intervening frame.  With a cadence the flip happens only on a rebuild, so
// the buffer being written was last read N frames ago -- longer, not shorter.
// A reuse frame writes nothing at all and needs no `sync` barrier.
//
// IT IS ONLY DEFENSIBLE BECAUSE THE WAVE IS SLOW.  Sampling a slow curve at
// 20 Hz and holding each sample for three frames is invisible; doing it to
// something with fast detail would judder. The two settings are therefore
// related, and lowering JW_SPEED is what makes a higher N free.//

    // WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT TELL YOU.  `gen` is real: the PPU microseconds
    // spent lofting, lighting and projecting the three layers, measured around
    // the build loop.  `verts` and `draws` are exact.  THE RSX's OWN COST IS
    // NOT HERE and cannot be -- the xmb: frame line's `gpu` bucket measures
    // submission, not rasterisation, and this client has no GPU timer.  Read
    // the RSX side from `vsync` in that line instead: vsync is the part of the
    // 60 Hz budget the frame did NOT use, so if JellyWave costs the GPU real
    // time, vsync shrinks by it.  Compare a mode 2 capture against a mode 3
    // one on the same screen.
    //
    // COUNTED PER CALL, NOT PER FRAME.  wave_draw() has six call sites and the
    // screens that composite the background twice call it twice, exactly as
    // they always did; `gen` is therefore the cost of ONE build, and a screen
    // that draws the background twice pays it twice.  That is the same
    // behaviour the legacy path has -- it rebuilds every vertex on each call
    // too -- but it is worth knowing when reading the number against a frame
    // budget.

// framebuffer once per pixel (`u32 bg = row[x]`) to composite its triangular
// alpha falloff, 1920 reads every frame.  It measured **1,351 us -- 704 ns per
// pixel**, which is the PPU's VRAM read cost almost exactly, and 76 % of the
// `cards` bucket.  It cost that on every screen, because the hairline is
// always full width.
//
// The falloff is `a = 72 * min(x, W-x) * 2 / W`: zero at both edges, peak at
// the centre, linear between.  That is exactly what the GPU interpolates
// across two quads, so THREE columns of vertices reproduce it with no
// approximation at all -- and no reads.  Six vertices, submitted inline.
