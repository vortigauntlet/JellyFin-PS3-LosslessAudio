// The depth engine's draw half: one stage renderer for every category.
//
// depth.h decides where every item is (and is host-tested); this draws what
// it decided, with the primitives the client already proves on hardware --
// constant-alpha card quads (ui_card_gpu_draw_ex), blended rects, and the
// wave's immediate-mode fans.  Nothing here reads video memory, allocates, or
// touches the JellyWave vertex path.
//
// A category hands the stage a range of item indices and a callback that
// resolves index -> DepthCard for this frame.  The stage draws, in the one
// order that reads as depth:
//
//   1. the focus halo's glow, BEHIND everything;
//   2. every card, FAR TO NEAR (by distance from the focus), each with its
//      veil and its reflection -- so an item flying forward lands on top of
//      anything it passes;
//   3. the halo's accent bands and frame, and thin progress strips, OVER.
//
// Home (ui_home_stage.inc) resolves cards on the column->queue swing, the
// libraries (xmb/ui_depth_lib.cpp) on the column->grid swing.  That callback
// is the ONLY thing that differs between them.
