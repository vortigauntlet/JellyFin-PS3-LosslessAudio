// JellyWave stage 0b: ONE light, shared by everything in the scene.
//
//   wave_cam.h    world space -> clip space
//   wave_light.h  the one shared light + its LUTs      (this file)
//   wave_gel.h    the lofted translucent body
//
// WHY ONE LIGHT, IN ITS OWN FILE
//
// The reverse-engineering pass on the reference XMB wave found that what makes
// its particles look like they belong to the wave is not their density -- it
// is that the motes and the ribbon are shaded by the SAME light vector, so a
// mote glints exactly when the travelling highlight passes it.  Correlation,
// not count.  Nothing enforces that if each consumer carries its own copy of
// the light; putting it in one header and having the gel and the motes both
// call into it is the mechanism, and it is the reason this file exists at all
// rather than four constants in wave_gel.h.
//
// WHAT IS REPRODUCED AND WHAT IS APPROXIMATED
//
// The design (design-import-jellywave/three-d-stage.js) lights the object with
// an ambient term, three directional lights, and a PMREM environment probe,
// then runs ACES filmic tone mapping at exposure 1.25.  The three directions
// and the four colours are taken from it verbatim -- they are the design.
//
// The ENVIRONMENT PROBE IS NOT reproduced.  It is a 1024x512 equirect baked to
// a mip chain, sampled per fragment by roughness; there is no texture unit in
// the wave's path and adding one is the single riskiest change available here.
// What the probe actually contributes to this object is a cool lobe above and
// to the right, a violet lobe below and to the left, and three small hard
// lobes that produce the crisp secondary speculars wet gel shows.  The first
// two are a hemispheric term and are folded into JW_AMB_SKY / JW_AMB_GND; the
// third is what JW_SPEC_LUT's narrow core stands in for.
//
// INTENSITIES ARE CALIBRATED HERE, NOT COPIED.  The design's numbers (key 3.4,
// fill 0.75, rim 0.9) are three.js intensities, which mean something specific
// inside its physically-based renderer -- a per-light division by pi, a
// different albedo convention, and a tone-map curve applied to the whole
// framebuffer.  Feeding those literals into this much simpler evaluator gives
// a different picture, so the RATIOS are kept and the absolute scale is set by
// JW_EXPOSURE, which is measured against the target luma bands in
// tests/test_wave_light.c rather than assumed.
//
// House rules (.clinerules rule 7): header-only, pure C, no libm, no PS3
// headers, deterministic, caller-owned state, no globals.  The LUTs are
// LITERAL tables rather than generated at init on purpose: a generated table
// would be file-scope dynamic initialisation, which wave_field.h's WF_DRIVE
// comment already rejects for this target.  The generating formulas are given
// with each table and test_wave_light.c re-derives them, so a hand-edit that
// drifts from the formula fails the build rather than the TV.

// --- Fresnel, and the mistake that is easy to make here -------------------
//
// The first build of this rig added the Fresnel LUT straight into the result
// as its own glow term, at 0.38 of the key colour.  MEASURED, that inverted
// the design: the lower body came out at luma 0.365 and the rolled edge at
// 0.325 -- the edge DIMMER than the body it is supposed to define.
//
// The reason is geometry, not tuning.  The camera sits 9.25 degrees above the
// horizontal and the band lies almost flat, so its top and bottom faces are
// seen at about 81 degrees off their own normals -- n.v is 0.16 and the
// Fresnel LUT reads 0.73 across nearly the whole visible surface.  A flat add
// at grazing therefore brightens EVERYTHING by the same amount, which is
// exactly the "one bright mid-tone" failure that makes a translucent body look
// like flat plastic.  No value of a single gain fixes it; the term was the
// wrong shape.
//
// The design does not have this problem because its grazing response is
// DIRECTIONAL: clearcoat Fresnel there is a weight on an environment
// reflection, so a grazing surface only brightens when it happens to be
// reflecting one of the probe's lobes.  Fresnel is a weight on a specular
// term, not a term of its own.
//
// So it is two terms here, both cheap:
//
//   JW_FRES_SPEC   Fresnel multiplies the KEY's highlight, so grazing surfaces
//                  get a stronger specular rather than a brighter body.  This
//                  is the physically right structure and it restores the
//                  directionality the probe was supplying.
//
//   JW_FRES_EDGE   a Fresnel term gated by wave_gel.h's GEOMETRIC rim weight,
//                  so the rolled edge -- and only the rolled edge -- keeps the
//                  strong grazing response the design's flat-topped rim band
//                  is built to show.
#define JW_FRES_SPEC   1.600000f
#define JW_FRES_EDGE   0.450000f

// Tone-map exposure.  The design runs ACES filmic at 1.25 over a renderer
// whose light units differ from this evaluator's, so this is the calibration
// constant for the whole rig -- see INTENSITIES ARE CALIBRATED above.
// MEASURED in tests/test_wave_light.c against three bands:
//   a top-facing surface at the band's centre  -> luma 0.55 .. 0.75
//   the underside                              -> luma 0.04 .. 0.14

// of the curve needs no special case -- the same reason wave_field.h uses 257
// samples.

//        = (1 - (g-0.12)/0.88)^4    above it
//
// THE FLAT TOP IS THE POINT, and it is why this is a table rather than a
// pow().  The reference wave's Fresnel LUT was measured and found to be
// saturated across its first tenth before decaying -- not a power curve at
// all.  A flat top is what makes a translucent edge read as ROUNDED AND
