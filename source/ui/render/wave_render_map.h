// The calibration seam: stage B's unitless parameters -> the three arguments
// ui_wave.cpp already passes wf_step(), plus a height multiplier per ribbon
// and a colour multiplier, which are the two things the renderer can take
// without a geometry or GPU-state change.
//
// JellyWave 2.0 adds two more, both still CPU-side numbers handed to code
// that already takes them: a body SWELL from the low-mids (a multiplier on
// the layer's scale, i.e. its half-width and half-thickness), and stage B's
// travelling pulses as an ACCENT -- a smooth bump added to the solver's
// displacement curve before the loft reads it.  Neither touches a vertex
// format, a buffer, a draw call or GPU state.
//
// STILL NOT CARRIED, and why: detail[] and phase[] have no input on the spring
// chain (it makes its own fine detail from perturb and its own phase from
// integration); lift moves the whole band, which would shift its framing; hue
// would have to re-tint wave_gel.h's lit colour per vertex.  wave_layers.h
// consumes all of them and is not wired in.
//
//   wave_audio.h       PCM -> features
//   wave_motion.h      features -> slew-limited parameters
//   wave_render_map.h  parameters -> this renderer's numbers   (this file)
//
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE AND NOT THREE LINES IN THE GLUE
//
// wave_motion.h's ranges are chosen for the MODEL: drive runs 0.35 at rest to
// 1.10 at full, because that is where the spring chain behaves.  ui_wave.cpp's
// ranges are chosen for the SCREEN: it divides wf_disp's output by
// WF_NOMINAL_PEAK (0.653, measured at drive 1.0) to land the ribbons back on
// their authored WAVE_AMP pixel heights, so the pixel amplitude is directly
// proportional to whatever drive it is handed, and drive 1.0 is "today's
// look".
//
// Those two ranges do not line up, and feeding one straight into the other
// gets both ends wrong:
//
//   AT REST.  Stage B idles at drive 0.35.  Through ui_wave.cpp's fixed
//   normalisation that is 35% of today's ribbon height -- 10 px, 8 px and 5 px
//   for the three layers.  That does not read as "calm", it reads as broken,
//   and the XMB with no music playing is the state this client spends most of
//   its life in.
//
//   AT FULL.  Stage B's ceiling is 1.10 because that is the largest drive that
//   keeps the chain clear of WK_KNEE (0.80) -- see WL_BASE_MAX.  Any mapping
//   that scales ABOVE 1.10 to get a bigger swing puts the solver inside its own
//   soft clip, where it stops responding to level at all.
//
// So the mapping is a compressed lerp between two endpoints that were each
// picked for a reason, and both reasons are testable.  It is header-only and
// PS3-header-free so test_wave_layers.c can assert them against the real
// kernel (.clinerules rule 7).

// can raise it.  No mapping needed and none wanted.

// --- per-ribbon amplitude ------------------------------------------------
// drive moves all three chains together.  This is what makes them move
// DIFFERENTLY: stage B's amp[] is already split by band through
// WM_LAYER_MIX, and this carries it to the renderer as a multiplier on each
// ribbon's authored height.
//
// Keyed by SOLVER layer, not by screen depth, because the two renderers
// disagree about depth -- JellyWave draws solver layer 0 nearest, the legacy
// ribbons draw it furthest back.  What both agree on is that layer 0 is the
// widest, slowest chain and layer 2 the narrowest, fastest one (WF_DRIVE
// 1.00 / 0.85 / 0.70, WF_RATE 1.00 / 0.78 / 1.34), so:
//
//   solver 0  <- Swell                 bass       the big slow swing
//   solver 1  <- mean(Body, Filament)  low-mid / mid
//   solver 2  <- Sheen                 high / air  the quick, fine one
//
// Centred on WM_IDLE_AMP so REST IS EXACTLY 1.0 and the no-music look does not
// change: stage B idles every layer at 0.34, and dividing by that instead
// (the obvious mapping) would have multiplied a full band by 2.9.
//
// WRM_AMP_MAX IS MEASURED.  The real solver at WRM_DRIVE_MAX, WM_MAX_PERTURB
// and WRM_TS_MAX, lofted through wave_gel.h with disp_gain scaled up, first
// breaks test_wave_gel.c's framing box at 1.75x -- the near layer's top edge
// reaches the horizontal midline.  At 1.30x that edge peaks at -0.099 in clip
// space, a tenth of the screen's half-height below the line; on the legacy
// ribbons it is 30 px * 1.10 * 1.30 = 43 px against a crest at 78% of the

// One multiplier on the ribbon's colour: louder is brighter, and an onset adds
// a short sheen on top.  Also centred so rest is exactly 1.0.
//
// KEPT SMALL ON PURPOSE.  wave_motion.h's own rule is that a beat which

//   glow    0 .. 1                             ->  +0 .. +0.08
//
// and the step between frames is bounded by stage B's slews rather than by
// anything here: at 60 fps the worst case is WM_SLEW_BRIGHT * 0.30 +
// WM_SLEW_GLOW_UP * 0.08 = 0.017 a frame, so the full rise takes a fifth of a

// --- the accent (JellyWave 2.0) ----------------------------------------
// A stage B pulse is an object: it spawns on an onset, travels the band over
// two beats and fades on a C1 envelope.  Here it becomes a smooth compact
// bump, (1 - q^2)^2, added to the solver's displacement -- a swell that runs

//                  accent, not a second wave.  Measured -- see WRM_THICK_MAX.
//   WRM_ACC_WIDEN  the ribbon's bump is twice stage B's pulse width, 0.15 to
//                  0.30 in u.  JellyWave re-samples its geometry every third
//                  frame, and a pulse at 120 BPM moves 0.057 u between
//                  samples; against a bump this broad that reads as travel,
//                  against stage B's raw width it read as stepping.
//   WRM_ACC_LAYER  full on the near/widest layer, less on the others, so the

// --- distinct bands (2026-09-24) -------------------------------------------
//
// Hardware verdict on the mapping above: "it all moves at a similar intensity;
// you can't tell the lows, mids and highs apart".  The log said why: during
// music `drive` went 0.62 -> 1.02 (every layer ~65% taller, together), `ts`
// sat at 1.2-1.3 (the whole wave faster, together), while the per-band
// heights only separated by +-15% (amp 0.88..1.16) -- shared terms swamping
// the per-band ones, and the per-band ones built from MIXED bands.
//
// This is applied on top of wrm_map_gain()'s result by the glue:
//
//   * The shared terms are held near rest: tempo no longer speeds the wave
//     (dt_scale 1.0), loudness keeps only a fifth of its drive swing (capped
//     at WRM_DB_DRIVE_MAX), and the broadband ripple and brightness keep a
//     fraction.  The base motion stays slow and calm under any music.
//   * Each solver layer then follows ONE part of the spectrum, taken straight
//     from stage A's bands, with its own timing -- so the three read as three
//     different instruments:
//
//       layer 0 (near, widest)   sub + bass       slow heavy swell   att 60 ms / rel 420 ms

//       layer 2 (far, finest)    high + air       quick flicker      att 15 ms / rel 120 ms
//
//     height from WRM_DB_AMP_QUIET (a band that is quiet sinks BELOW rest,
//     which is what makes the loud one stand out) to WRM_DB_AMP_MAX, and a
//     per-layer brightness, strongest on the highs.
//   * At rest (no audio, silence latched) every output is exactly the rest
//     value, as before.

// test_look_framing measured (drive 1.10 x amp 1.30) is spent differently,

//   * the height spring is STIFFER ON THE WAY UP than on the way down -- a hit
//     snaps up, the fall stays the soft, physical settle

// spring was soft, and the first hit raised the "recent" level the second
// was measured against.  So: a shorter punch release (shorter still with
