// JellyWave stage 9: the motes.
//
//   wave_cam.h    world space -> clip space
//   wave_light.h  the one shared light + its LUTs
//   wave_gel.h    the lofted translucent body
//   wave_motes.h  the drifting glints around it                 (this file)
//
// NOT WIRED IN.  Nothing in ui_wave.cpp includes this yet, on purpose: the
// JellyWave frame is over budget on the RSX (see the jellywave notes), and a
// particle field is more RSX work at exactly the point that is short.  This
// file is the simulation and the shading, finished and host-tested, so wiring
// it is a renderer task and not a design task.  What the renderer will need to
// add is described at the bottom.
//
// WHAT IT IS
//
// A cloud of small flakes hanging in the air around the band.  They are
// neither falling nor fired: they sit near neutral buoyancy, drift slowly
// along the band on a light wind, jostle under random forcing, and are held
// loosely around the band by a pull toward its CENTRELINE -- a line, not a
// point.  A point attractor collapses any such cloud into a ball; a line only
// constrains the two directions across the band and leaves the motes free
// along it, so the cloud takes the band's shape.  Each flake tumbles slowly,
// and glints when its face turns to reflect the key light at the camera.
//
// WHY THE LIGHT IS SHARED
//
// What makes motes look like they belong to the ribbon is not how many there
// are -- it is that they are lit by the SAME light.  wave_light.h exists so
// there is one key direction, one specular lobe and one definition of "lit" in
// the scene; this file calls jw_key_lit() and indexes JW_SPEC_LUT at
// JW_SPEC_I rather than carrying copies, so the flakes glint from the same
// direction and with the same lobe shape as the gel's wet highlight.
//
// ONE DELIBERATE DIFFERENCE from jw_specular(): the half vector is computed
// ONCE per shade call, from the eye vector at the cloud's centre, instead of
// per mote.  The gel needs the per-vertex eye vector for its grazing response
// along a rolled edge; a flake has no edge, and the eye vector's swing across
// the cloud only changes WHICH flakes glint, not what a glint looks like.  It
// saves two reciprocal square roots a mote.
//
// THE AUDIO, through wave_motion.h's stage B only -- no second analyser:
//
//   amp[0]     (bass)          the cloud breathes: stronger random forcing,
//                              so it spreads, over about a second
//   detail[3]  (highs, fast)   flakes spin faster, so cymbals sparkle
//   glow       (onsets)        glints brighten
//   bright     (loudness)      the whole cloud brightens
//   hue        (centroid)      the flakes' own colour, violet -> blue
//   lift                       the cloud rises
//   timescale  (tempo)         everything runs faster
//   pulse[]    (beats)         a travelling pulse LIFTS and lights the motes
//                              it passes under -- a ripple running through
//                              the cloud, which is the "gesture, not strobe"
//                              stage B's pulses were designed for
//
// Every one of those is exactly neutral at stage B's idle values, so a client
// with no music gets the same motes as one with the analyser off.
//
// STROBE SAFETY.  A particle field can strobe in a way a ribbon cannot: many
// small sources changing together.  Four things stop it, and
// test_wave_motes.c measures the result rather than trusting them:
//   - lifetimes start staggered, so births and deaths are spread over time
//     instead of arriving in waves;
//   - the spin rate is capped so a bright glint lasts at least eight frames
//     at the fastest the audio can make a flake spin;
//   - every way a mote can die other than old age happens at zero alpha,
//     because the shading fades it out before each boundary;
//   - every audio input arrives already slewed by stage B.
// The test bound is on the TOTAL light the field emits from one frame to the
// next -- individual flakes twinkling is the point; the whole field pulsing
// is the bug.
//
// ORIGINAL WORK (.clinerules rule 10).  The model comes from a prose
// description -- near-neutral buoyancy, wind, random forcing, an attractor
// that does not collapse the cloud, depth of field -- and every constant
// below is derived from THIS scene: the band's geometry in wave_gel.h, the
// camera in wave_cam.h, and the spread and speed wanted on screen.  None is
// taken from captured data.
//
// House rules (.clinerules rule 7): header-only, pure C, no libm, no PS3
// headers, struct-of-arrays, caller-owned state, no globals.  The per-mote
// loops are branchless apart from the ternary selects, which compile to
// fsel/isel on the PPU.

// Semi-implicit Euler with the drag applied implicitly, which is

// cap.  The random forcing is scaled by sqrt(dt) so the spread does not
// depend on the frame rate.
//
// RESPAWN IS A SELECT, NOT A BLEND.  jf_anim_kernel.h respawns with
// keep*x + dead*x0, which is fine for it; here one of the reasons to respawn
// is that a value went non-finite, and 0 * NaN is NaN -- the blend would carry
// the fault into the new mote.  A ternary picks one side and never multiplies
// the other.
//
// The respawn candidate reuses this frame's random draws.  They are
// independent of the mote's current state, so the candidate is correctly
// distributed, and on a respawn frame the forcing they also fed is thrown
// away with the old velocity -- six draws a mote a frame instead of ten.
