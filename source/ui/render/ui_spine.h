// The spine, drawn and driven.  Geometry lives in spine.h; this is the
// XMB-side glue.  Everything here is inert unless jellyfin_spine.txt says 1.
//
// Two levels today (SPINE-PLAN.md S1 + the base layer of S4):
//
//   base  (L1)  the spine IS the content.  Left/Right walks the tabs, and the
//               active tab's items hang in a column under its icon.  Down or
//               X enters the tab.
//   tab   (L2)  the tab's own screen, as it has always been, under a smaller
//               spine.  Up from its top row, or O at its root, returns to base.
//
// That is the PS3 XMB's shape -- and 1etu/XMP's (MIT), whose navigation model
// this follows: a root row you can always get back to, entered downward.
