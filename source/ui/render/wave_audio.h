// Written to docs/wave-audio-spec.md sections 2, 3.4 and 3.5.  Nothing here
// is derived from any reference implementation's code: the reference material
// (audio_reactive_analysis.md) contains a property list and four sentences of
// visual description, and the two mappings it actually proposes -- one line
// per band, and a dark-blue-to-bright-red intensity ramp -- are rejected in
// the spec.  What is taken from it is one principle: silence is a state with
// its own animation and needs an explicit threshold (.clinerules rule 10).
//
// House rules (.clinerules rule 7): header-only, pure C, no libm, no PS3
// headers, struct-of-arrays where it matters, deterministic, and NO GLOBALS --
// all state is caller-owned, so the host test runs this exact code rather than
// a stand-in for it.
//
// THREADING.  wa_push() writes the filter state; wa_frame() reads and resets
// it.  They are not synchronised here and must not run concurrently.  On the
// console that is the same contract music_fft.cpp already has between the
// decoder thread and the UI thread, and it is the caller's mutex, not ours --
// this header has no PS3 headers and no locks by design.

// --- filter ---------------------------------------------------------------
// Two cascaded one-pole lowpasses per edge, and each band is the difference
// of two adjacent cascades.  Chosen over an FFT for the reasons in spec
// section 7.2; the properties that matter to the code below are:
//
//   UNCONDITIONALLY STABLE.  a is in (0,1) for every positive frequency and
//   every sample rate, and lp += a*(x-lp) is then a convex combination, so
//   |lp| <= max(|lp|, |x|).  No stability condition to check, no resonance to
//   blow up, nothing to clamp.  A Chamberlin state-variable filter would be
//   sharper but its stability limit (f < 2 - q) is reached by the top band at
//   48 kHz, which is exactly the kind of thing that works on the bench and
//   fails on one particular track.
//
//   EXACTLY ZERO AT DC.  Every lowpass has unity gain at DC, so the
//   difference of any two of them is exactly zero there -- in float, not just
//   in theory, because both cascades converge to the same value bit for bit
//   on a constant input.  A DC offset in the PCM (which decoders do produce)
//   therefore cannot leak into SUB, and no DC blocker is needed.
//   test_wave_audio.c asserts this.
//
//   12 dB/OCTAVE SKIRTS, DELIBERATELY BROAD.  Measured at 48 kHz with a
//   full-scale sine at each band's geometric centre: every band's maximum IS
//   its own band (test_wave_audio.c asserts exactly that), but an ADJACENT
//   band is only 0.3 - 4.6 dB down, a band two away is 7 - 10 dB down going
//   up and 19 - 26 dB going down, and anything further is 25 - 60 dB down.
//
//   So the separation is weak between neighbours and strong between the pairs
//   that actually drive different things: SUB/BASS against HIGH/AIR, which
//   drive the far geometry and the fine detail respectively, are 27 - 60 dB
//   apart.  Neighbours blurring into each other is not a defect here, it is
//   the point -- adjacent bands drive adjacent layers, and adjacent layers are
//   meant to move as one family with a phase gradient across them rather than
//   independently, which is what a physical medium does.
//
//   Three cascaded poles were measured and are WORSE, not better: the extra
//   pole drags each cascade's effective corner further below its nominal one,
//   which moves every band's peak up into the band above it.  Two is right.
