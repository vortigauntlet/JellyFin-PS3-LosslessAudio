//  Matroska as MPEG-TS: what the player's decode path already reads
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  The player's whole pipeline (stream_read -> ts_process -> VDEC and the audio
//  decoders) speaks MPEG-TS.  Rather than teach it a second container, a Matroska
//  file is presented as the TS an ffmpeg muxer would write for it:
//
//    PAT and PMT before the first picture and before every key frame (a seek
//    resets the demuxer, so the stream can be entered at any key frame);
//    video: one PES per access unit, PTS only, H.264 in Annex B (the length prefixes
//    become start codes, an access-unit delimiter leads, and SPS and PPS from the avcC
//    come before every key frame);
//    audio: one PES per frame, the codec's bytes as stored (AC-3, DTS and TrueHD
//    frames are identical in both containers), the stream type the demuxer knows it by.
//
//  Time starts at the first key frame: stream PTS 0 (plus MKV_TS_PTS_BASE_90K) is
//  that frame, the way the server's transcode restarts at a seek, so the audio
//  clock and play_base_us mean what they always mean.  The caller gets the key
//  frame's position in the file back to put in play_base_us.
//
//  One video and at most one audio track are written; picking the audio track is the
//  caller's, and a track change is a reopen at the current position, as on the server path.
