# Changelog

## 3.1

**The new interface is now what everyone gets.** In 3.0 (and the beta before it),
the layered interface, JellyWave, and the GPU-drawn posters and text were all
switched off unless a setting file existed on the console, and nothing created
those files. A fresh install showed the old tab strip, a flat three-band wave,
and slower CPU-drawn menus. They are all on by default now. If you installed 3.0,
installing 3.1 over it is all you need to do.

### New
- **Settings → Software Update.** Shows the result of the launch check (up to
  date, a newer version available, or couldn't check). `X` checks again, or
  reopens the update popup when there is a new version.
- The update popup now says where to get the new `.pkg`.

### Controls
- **`O` stops playback**, the same as `Start`, whether or not the player bar is
  showing. If a track menu or the volume slider is open, `O` closes that first.
- **`□` hides the player bar** without waiting for it to time out. The player
  stats overlay is still on the remote's `DISPLAY` key and in Settings.
- **Remotes without `L1`/`R1`:** the Blu-ray remote's `|<<` `>>|` and `<<` `>>`
  keys now switch tabs in the menus, so a Bluetooth remote can reach every tab.
  Unrecognised remote keys are written to the debug log so they can be mapped.

### Fixes
- **Home posters on the selected row.** The poster cache has a fixed number of
  slots, and when Home wanted more than fit, the row you were looking at could
  lose out: some of its posters stayed blank until you moved off it. The
  selected row now loads first.
- JellyWave moves at the speed it was tuned to on a TV (a little calmer than 3.0's
  default).

### Turning things back off
Each of these still has a file in `/dev_hdd0/tmp/`; put `0` in it to switch that
feature off: `jellyfin_spine.txt` (layered interface), `jellyfin_gpuwave.txt`
(JellyWave), `jellyfin_gpucards.txt` and `jellyfin_gputext.txt` (GPU posters and
text). `jellyfin_jwspeed.txt` sets the JellyWave speed (default 14).
