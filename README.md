## Recommended settings

Defaults are safe but conservative. For a Blu-ray remux on a wired console:

| Setting | Where | Set it to |
|---|---|---|
| **Quality** | Triangle on a title → Quality row | **Max** |
| **Audio Output** | Settings → Audio Output | **5.1** |

**Audio Output** is Stereo / 5.1 / 7.1, and 7.1 appears only where the chain
reports that it takes eight channels of LPCM — the app queries the connected
display rather than assuming. A surround mode asks the server to stream-copy
the source's own HD audio track and decodes it here; when a source has no HD
track it falls back to an AC-3 5.1 transcode automatically, which is why there
is no separate AC-3 option to pick.

On 5.1 the app also applies a **routing fix**, because the cellAudio port is 8
channels wide while the HDMI output is 6, so the console folds 8→6 on the way
out — and on some receivers that fold loses the centre channel, taking the
dialogue with it. The app's own per-channel meter showed the centre leaving hot
(loudest of the three fronts in 59% of heartbeats, never silent) while nothing
reached the speaker, so the loss is downstream of us. Asking the console to
treat the output as 5.1 corrects it. **The wire stays uncompressed LPCM** —
verified with `audioOutGetState` — so lossless TrueHD and DTS-HD MA arrive
intact, and if a receiver ever does accept the request for real the app detects
that and reverts rather than let your audio be silently compressed. It is not a
setting, because there is nothing for a listener to decide; 7.1 skips it,
having no 8→6 fold to correct.

**Dialogue Boost** (Off / +3 / +6 / +10 dB) is a separate row and is about
level, not routing: none of these decoders applies dynamic range compression,
so full cinema range can leave dialogue well below effects on a compact system.

The Quality row runs 360p → 480p → 720p → **High** (10 Mbps) → **Very High**
(20) → **Max** (25), and prints the bitrate beside the name.

**Why Max stops at 25 Mbps.** The console can only *receive* about 25 Mbps
sustained. That is measured, not guessed, and it is the server that proves it:
the same Jellyfin endpoint hands a PC on the same LAN 537 Mbps. Back to back on
the same film, on an otherwise identical build:

| setting | throughput | frames on time | buffer ran empty |
|---|---|---|---|
| **25 Mbps** | 30.1 Mbps | **98%** | **never** |
| 30 Mbps | 25.0 Mbps | 30% | 68% of samples |

Note which way the throughput goes. Asking for 30 delivers *less* than asking
for 25, because the 30.1 is the buffer being topped up in bursts against a
demand of only 25 — it is fill rate with headroom, not a sustained rate. Ask
for 30 sustained and you get 25. A buffer bridges a spike; it cannot bridge a
permanent shortfall, so steps above 25 were removed rather than left in to
disappoint.

The quality you pick is remembered **per title**, so a heavy remux and a light
episode can each keep their own.

If playback stutters, drop to **Very High** before anything else.

## What it does

- **Movies, TV, Collections and Music.** Everything shows up as poster and still
  card grids, with an A-Z jump bar and scrollbars so you always know where you are
  in a big library.
- **A home shelf** that mirrors the Jellyfin web app, with Continue Watching, Next
  Up, and Recently Added rows.
- **Hardware H.264 playback** through the PS3's VDEC. The display loop runs at a
  smooth 60 fps and blends frames so 24 fps content doesn't judder.
- **AV sync stays locked to within ±5 ms** off the audio clock.
- **Resume and progress reporting.** Stop watching on the PS3 and it shows up as
  Continue Watching everywhere else. The next episode auto-advances, too.
- **An in-player HUD** with a seek bar, transport controls, and audio/subtitle
  track menus. Subtitles are burned in on the server side.
- **Pre-play version selection** on the Triangle item-info screen for local
  multi-version files and MediaSources supplied by Gelato/AIOStreams.
- **Seek, skip and scrub.** Tap to jump 10 seconds, or hold to scrub the bar.
- **A full music player.** Albums, Artists, Playlists, Genres and Songs, a play
  queue with shuffle, and a Now Playing screen whose 28-band spectrum visualizer
  actually reacts to what you're hearing.
- **Live search**, an on-screen keyboard, item info overlays, and a thumbnail cache
  that keeps browsing quick.
- **An update check at launch** that pops up quietly when a newer release is out.

## Surround sound

Movies can play in **surround**: the app decodes the audio on the PS3 and
sends it out as multichannel LPCM. It is **off by default** — **Settings →
Audio Output** cycles through:

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Stereo** | Stereo MP3 — the shipped path, untouched. The default. |
| **5.1** | Sends the source's own HD audio track untouched (no audio transcode) and decodes it here. **TrueHD / Dolby Atmos** plays **losslessly**. **DTS-HD MA** also plays **losslessly** — its XLL extension is decoded, verified bit-exact against ffmpeg on x86 *and* on the PPU's own big-endian PowerPC. **DTS, DTS-HD HRA, DTS-ES and DTS:X** play from their 5.1 core at up to 1509 kbps. Anything else, including Dolby Digital Plus, falls back to an AC-3 5.1 transcode — so this never plays worse than asking for AC-3 directly, which is why there is no separate AC-3 option. |
| **7.1** | The same, at eight channels. **Only offered when your receiver reports that it accepts 8-channel LPCM** — the app asks the connected display rather than guessing, so most soundbars correctly see only Stereo and 5.1. |

**No dialogue, or a silent centre speaker?** On 5.1 the app also corrects a
fault that silences dialogue on some receivers. The PS3's audio port is 8
channels wide and its HDMI output is 6, so the console folds 8→6 on the way
out — and that fold can lose the centre channel, which is where nearly all the
dialogue in a film mix lives. This is not a setting; there is nothing for a
listener to decide, and it is on whenever 5.1 is. **Nothing is compressed to
achieve it** — the audio on the wire stays uncompressed LPCM, verified by
reading the output's actual state rather than the value that was requested.

**Dialogue still too quiet?** **Settings → Dialogue Boost** (Off / +3 / +6 /
+10 dB). None of these decoders applies dynamic range compression, so a film
mix's full cinema range can leave dialogue well below effects on a compact
system. It is a level control, not a routing one.

For actual surround output you must also tell the PS3 your setup can take it:

> **XMB → Settings → Sound Settings → Audio Output Settings** — select your
> connector (HDMI/optical) and tick **Linear PCM 5.1 Ch. 44.1/48 kHz** (or your
> receiver's equivalent). Without this the PS3 silently mixes the 8-channel port
> down to stereo — the app cannot tell the difference, so check this first if
> everything plays but nothing comes out of the rears.

Notes and limitations:

- If the server cannot produce the fallback AC-3 5.1 transcode (old ffmpeg, or
  transcoding disabled), playback falls back to the shipped stereo MP3 path.
- Stereo-only sources still play in stereo (front speakers), as they should.
- There is **no bitstream passthrough** for homebrew on this platform, and that
  is now measured rather than assumed. PSL1GHT never bound `cellAudioOut`, so
  the request could not even be expressed; this app binds it directly and asks.
  The console reports **0 channels available** for TrueHD, DTS-HD MA and DD+,
  and when asked for AC-3 it accepts the request while leaving plain LPCM on
  the wire. Real passthrough appears to be tied to the Blu-ray player's
  privileged path. So everything is decoded on the PS3 and sent out as LPCM,
  and that sets what each format can be:
  - **TrueHD / Dolby Atmos: lossless.** The full 5.1 or 7.1 bed plays, bit for
    bit. Atmos *objects* are not rendered (no free renderer exists, and the
    app cannot know your speaker layout), so an Atmos track plays as its bed.
    See [docs/dolby-truehd.md](docs/dolby-truehd.md).
  - **DTS-HD MA: lossless.** The XLL extension is decoded, not just the
    backward-compatible core — verified bit-exact against ffmpeg on x86 and on
    the PPU's own big-endian PowerPC. **DTS:X** plays its 5.1 bed; the object
    data is not rendered, for the same reason as Atmos. **DTS-HD HRA and
    DTS-ES** play from their core, at up to 1509 kbps.
    See [docs/dts-hd.md](docs/dts-hd.md).
  - **Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC-3), including DD+ Atmos: unchanged.** Nothing
    here decodes it; the server transcodes it to AC-3 5.1 as before.
- HD mode streams the original audio track over your network instead of a
  640 kbps transcode — a TrueHD or DTS-HD MA track can be several Mbps on top
  of the video. That is fine on a LAN and a bad idea over the internet.
- 7.1 needs **Linear PCM 7.1 Ch.** ticked in the PS3's Sound Settings, the same
  way 5.1 does — and the app only offers 7.1 at all when the connected chain
  reports it will take eight channels.
- Music playback is stereo by design and ignores this switch.
- The **Player Stats Overlay** shows the negotiated result while playing:
  `truehd 8/8` is a lossless 7.1 bed, `truehd 6/8` a lossless 5.1 one,
  `ac3 6/8` is a working AC-3 5.1 transcode, `dts-hd 6/8` a DTS-HD/DTS:X track
  playing from its core, and `mp3 2/2` means the server fell back to stereo.

## Requirements

- A PS3 running **Evilnat CFW** or **HEN** (CEX)
- A **Jellyfin server** the console can reach (a local network is easiest)
- To build it yourself: the **ps3dev toolchain** (`ppu-gcc`, typically installed
  under `/usr/local/ps3dev/`) plus a **PSL1GHT** SDK checkout. Export `PSL1GHT`
  to point at the checkout and `PS3DEV` to your toolchain prefix — the `.pkg`
  target needs `sfo.xml` from `$PS3DEV/bin/sfo.xml`

---

## Install

**[⬇ JellyFin-PS3.pkg — latest release](https://github.com/vortigauntlet/JellyFin-PS3-LosslessAudio/releases/latest)**

Direct link to the current build: [`JellyFin-PS3.pkg`](https://github.com/vortigauntlet/JellyFin-PS3-LosslessAudio/releases/latest/download/JellyFin-PS3.pkg).  
The same file is mirrored in [`release/`](release/) in the repo.

Then either:

- **USB:** copy the `.pkg` to the root of a USB stick, plug it into the console,
  and install it from the XMB (Game → Package Manager → Install Package Files), or
- **FTP:** drop it in `/dev_hdd0/packages/` and install it from webMAN MOD →
  Package Manager, no USB needed.

Installing over an existing copy is fine — your login and settings live outside
the app and are kept.

## Build from source

```bash
export PSL1GHT=/path/to/PSL1GHT
export PS3DEV=/usr/local/ps3dev

make clean && make      # SELF only
make pkg                # installable PKG
```

That gives you `JellyFin---PS3.self` and `JellyFin---PS3.pkg`.

> Cutting a release? Bump `APP_VERSION` in `source/net/update_check.h` to match the
> release tag so the update check compares against the right number.

## How it works

The architecture leans heavily on [Movian](https://github.com/andoma/showtime).
Its media player was the reference the whole app was built from.

**Video.** An HTTP MPEG-TS transcode stream gets demuxed on a decode thread. H.264
access units go to the PS3 VDEC (SPU-accelerated), decoded frames land in a 16-slot
jitter buffer, and a Movian-style 60 fps display loop blits them through the RSX. A
crossfade shader blends between decoded 24 fps frames using a Bresenham accumulator
locked to hardware vsync, which is what kills the usual 2:3 pulldown judder.

**Audio.** MP3 gets decoded with minimp3 into a PCM ring and pushed to the PS3 audio
DMA at 48 kHz. The audio PTS drives the master clock, and an EMA keeps AV sync inside
±5 ms.

**Seeking.** Jellyfin's transcode isn't byte-seekable, so seeks copy Movian's
flush-and-reopen path: stop the decode thread, flush the decoder, audio and jitter
buffer, re-request the stream at the new `StartTimeTicks`, then resume. The audio
clock re-seeds from the new segment, so the seek bar snaps to the right spot on its
own.

**Music.** The music player reuses the same audio port through a pluggable PCM
source that pulls Jellyfin's audio transcode endpoint. The spectrum visualizer taps
samples at the DMA read cursor rather than at decode time, so the bars match what's
coming out of the speakers instead of what's buffered a fraction of a second ahead.

<summary>Deeper technical notes (pipelines, HUD, threading, file layout)</summary>

### Video pipeline

```
HTTP stream (MPEG-TS)
        |
        v
  Decode thread: stream_read() -> 188-byte TS packets -> video_feed_ts()
  TS demuxer -> PAT/PMT -> PES reassembly
        |
        +- Audio PES -> adec_push_pes() -> minimp3 -> PCM ring
        |
        +- Video PES -> vdecDecodeAu() -> VDEC (SPU H.264)
                |
                v
         VDEC callback: vdec_pull_frame() -> YUV -> ARGB
                |
                v
         Jitter buffer (16 slots, ~28 MB at 720p, PTS + duration per slot)
                |
                v
         Upload thread -> RSX-local texture (double-buffered, A + B for blend)
                |
                v
         Display loop (60fps): Bresenham gate + gcmSetVBlankHandler @ 59.94 Hz
                |
                v
         RSX blit: crossfade shader blends A -> B mid-pulldown, flip()
```

- **FPS detection:** VDEC `frame_rate_code` maps to exact fractional fps
  (ISO 13818-2); refresh rate comes from `videoGetState` (59.94 Hz).
- **Temporal blending:** each frame carries a remaining duration. When it drops
  below one vblank and the next frame is ready, the shader crossfades on the
  fractional remainder, so there's no fixed pulldown pattern to fight.
- **AV sync:** `avsync_compute_diff()` takes video PTS minus audio PTS and smooths
  it with an EMA; each vblank period gets nudged ±5000 µs to correct drift. It's
  locked once that stays below ~41.6 ms.

### Seek pipeline

Modelled on Movian's `mp_flush` reposition path:

```
Compute target = audio_clock + delta -> Jellyfin 100-ns ticks (StartTimeTicks)
Stop decode thread (audio + upload keep running, idle on empty buffers)
Flush: vdec_flush() · adec_flush() · jbuf_clear() · video_reset_demux() · avsync_reset()
Re-request stream at new StartTimeTicks -> re-prefill jitter buffer
Respawn decode thread -> resume (audio clock re-seeds from new segment)
```

`SEEK_REOPEN_VDEC` swaps the decoder reset for a full close/open rebuild. It's
slower but bulletproof, handy for A/B testing on hardware.

### HUD overlay

The in-player HUD gets composed by the CPU into a staging buffer **only when its
content changes**, uploaded to an RSX texture, and then drawn each frame as one
alpha-blended quad over the video. That way a visible seek bar costs the display
loop almost nothing. Getting there took a few tries: a vertex-array quad that froze
the console on pause, a CPU framebuffer blend that tanked to ~5 fps, and a per-frame
CPU draw that halved the frame rate. The earlier dim-strip paths are still kept
behind compile defines for hardware testing:

| Define            | Path                                                  |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| (none, default)   | Inline GPU quad, fast and freeze-proof                |
| HUD_DIM_CPU       | CPU pixel blend, slow but bulletproof fallback        |
| HUD_DIM_GPU_ARRAY | Original array-fetch quad, known to freeze, test only |

While paused with no input, the display loop stops redrawing altogether. The frame
is pixel-identical anyway, so it just polls input at vblank rate until something
changes.

### Audio & burned-in subtitles

Picking a subtitle track flips the server to `SubtitleMethod=Encode`, which
front-loads several seconds of audio while the subtitle-burning encoder warms up. A
256-slot PES queue holds that burst compressed and the decoder back-pressures on the
PCM highwater, so nothing gets dropped and playback stays in sync. It used to skip
about 10 seconds ahead on real hardware before this fix.

### Version / MediaSource selection

Press Triangle on a playable title before starting it. When Jellyfin exposes
more than one source, the info page shows a **Version** row beneath Play. Focus
that row and press X for a scrollable list (up to 32 entries), or cycle it with
Left/Right. The chosen `MediaSourceId` is negotiated when Play is pressed, along
with that source's own audio/subtitle tracks. The version list is not retained
by the player and cannot be switched mid-stream. This covers normal Jellyfin
multi-version movies and plugin-provided alternatives such as Gelato/AIOStreams.

### Threading model

| Thread         | Priority | Role                                                     |
|----------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Display (main) | default  | Bresenham gate, RSX blit, flip, input poll, seek control |
| Decode         | 800      | TS demux, VDEC submit, jitter buffer fill                |
| Upload         | 850      | memcpy jitter buffer to RSX texture (A + B)              |
| Audio          | 750      | DMA event loop, PCM ring drain                           |
| Progress       | 1100     | POST position to Jellyfin every ~10 s                    |
| Async log      | 1200     | Ring-buffer drain to `player_log.txt` (when enabled)     |

On a seek, only the decode thread gets stopped and respawned.

## Logging

Debug logging is **off by default** and you toggle it from the Settings tab. That
choice sticks across restarts in `/dev_hdd0/tmp/jellyfin_settings.txt`. When it's on,
output goes to `/dev_hdd0/tmp/player_log.txt`. A crash log always gets written
synchronously to `/dev_hdd0/tmp/crash_log.txt`, and the launch update check leaves
its own trace in `/dev_hdd0/tmp/update_detection.txt`.

  app was built using Movian's media player as a reference. The video display loop,
  the temporal frame blending, and the flush-and-reopen seek path all follow how
  Movian does it. Big thanks to Andreas Öman and everyone who's worked on it.
